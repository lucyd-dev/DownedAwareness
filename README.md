Stay informed with this mod that provides crucial visual cues for downed or unconscious players. You'll see a marker on their location indicating the distance and the time remaining for a revive. Even after a player dies, their body's position will be highlighted for a default of 10 seconds, a setting you can adjust or turn off entirely.

If you like my mod, I would really appreciate if you leave a like ðŸ’œ

## Configuration

| Options                         | Default   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use a mod manager like Gale, you can change the .cfg settings in the launcher itself.\
> In order for the .cfg file to appear, you must launch the game once after installing/updating the mod!
